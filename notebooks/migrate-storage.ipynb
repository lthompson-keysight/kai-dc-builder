    "# Migration of results from v1 to v2\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook to migrate exiting trial results from format used by KAI DC Builder version 1.0 to the version 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed the standard storage migration guide, this script should work without any changes. Just run all the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start a DSE server version 2.0 with a mounted storage volume you want to migrate the data to. Copy existing v1 (source) data to the target storage location under the `v1` subfolder. For example, if the target storage location is `$HOME/dse-storage-v2/kaidcb`, copy the v1 data to `$HOME/dse-storage-v2/kaidcb/v1`.\n",
    "2. The DSE container ports 50001 and 49999 must be accessible from the Jupyter server running this notebook\n",
    "3. Install DSE client libraries in the Python kernel used by the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use `compose.nb.yml` Docker Compose file to satisfy the prerequisites 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the code section below to provide the addresses and port numbers of the DSE Controller and Storage Service to the rest of the notebook. If you're using `compose.nb.yml`, the default values should work without changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will call storage migration API on the DSE server. It will make the DSE server to take each result from the v1.0 storage location, convert them to the new format, and save them in the location provided to the storage service via `--fs_url` parameter."
